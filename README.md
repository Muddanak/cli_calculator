# cli_calculator
A command line calculator in Rust as I learn

# Usage
Pretty much run the executable with, like:
cli_calc.exe 1 + 2
cli_calc.exe 2 * 5 + 3

# Limitations
It doesn't do order of operations yet.  This was mostly written to learn the core concepts of Rust flow and data structures, along with safely handling them as best as I could find the info for.
