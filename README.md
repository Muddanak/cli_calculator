# cli_calculator
A command line calculator in Rust as I learn the language
Rust version 2021

# Ideas
Basically make it so it can take in things like 1 + 2 + 3 + (4 * 5) and make it handle it.  I've done this before a long, long time ago in C/C++ but now I'm just trying to remember how I did it back then and translate it into Rust.

# Usage
Pretty much run the executable with, like:
cli_calc.exe 1 + 2
cli_calc.exe 2 * 5 + 3

# Limitations
It doesn't do order of operations yet.  This was mostly written to learn the core concepts of Rust flow and data structures, along with safely handling them as best as I could find the info for.
